Local Shared Resource Library Site Front End
================================================

This component implements a Library Front End for accessing, browsing, searching
in sharedresources. It will provide also a Librarian backoffice to manange, list
update resource indexation information, among with some other site level services
such as OAI exposure. 

When browsed from a course context, the library keeps awareness of originating 
context and will allow direct resource publication from the library search results. 

Shared resource can be an alternative to "common Pot" filesystem repository, adding
possiblity to all teachers to feed collectively the resource base.
